# Exercise-1

In the “Taste of Python” lesson this week we have learned a few basic things in Python. Now you get your chance to demonstrate your skills. For this lesson, please do the following:

1. Open Jupyter lab from the [Exercise 1 landing page](https://geo-python.github.io/2018/lessons/L1/exercise-1.html#part-2-cooking-up-some-python) on the course site, and create a new notebook.

2. Inside the notebook, create a character string variable called `name` and use it to store your first- and lastname in a single string.

3. Create an integer variable called `iceCreamRating` and use it to store a number between 0 and 10 that reflects your general opinion about how much you enjoy eating ice cream.

4. Create a float variable called `sleepingIndex` and use it to store a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 that reflects your opinion about how much you enjoy sleeping. 

5. Use your Python skills to generate output on the screen similar to that below using a single command typed into the IPython console.

```
My name is Dave Whipp and I give eating ice cream a score of 9 out of 10!
I am Dave Whipp and my sleeping enjoyment index is 0.99 out of 1.0!
```

Note that your code should replace “Dave Whipp” with the contents of your `name` variable, and “9” with your value stored in the variable `iceCreamRating`, and "0.99" with your value stored in the variable `sleepingIndex`.

Upload your changes to github, on your **own** Exercise 1 repository that you cloned using the GitHub Classroom link.
